# GOTIME 
by Brendan Prednis

## Purpose
While doing most of my work, I use a pomodoro timer for keeping on task. The issue for me is that these are gui applications and take up uneccesary desktop space or are more than I need. 
I thought, "what better way to improve my go skills than make a cli pomodoro app?" 
Yes there are others already out there, but did I write them? Nope. 

## Why this one is different
While counting down is fun and all, I realized that while doing work, counting down doesn't seem like the right mentality. Maybe counting up could be more of a positive aspect to doing work. 

# Functionality (in progress)

- work flag
- break flag
- loop number flag 
- default times
